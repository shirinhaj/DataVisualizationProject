Data Set Name: Hand Gestures from Smartphone's Accelerometer

An LG Optimus Me smartphone was used to collect the gestures' accelerometer data. The data was collected by 10 subjects which performed 5 repetitions of 10 different gestures (triangle, square, circle, a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, 4) giving a total of 500 instances. The sensor is a tri-axial accelerometer which returns values for the x,y and z axes.

Relevant Information:
This dataset comprises 5 repetitions of 10 different gestures. There were 10 volunteers who participated in the experiment. The gestures were: (triangle, square, circle, a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, 4). The participants were not instructed to hold the smartphone in any particular manner. The sampling rate was set at 50 Hz. To record a gesture the user presses the phone screen with his/her thumb, performs the gesture and stops pressing the screen.

Attribute Information:

Each directory represents a different subject.  And the filenames have the following format:

label_date_time.txt

where label indicates the name of the gesture.  Each file contains 3 columns: x acceleration, y acceleration and z acceleration. The files have not the same length.

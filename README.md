# DataVisualizationProject

<h1>Step 1: Project Folder</h1>
Download or clone the "DataVisualizationProject" folder into your desired location on your Windows system.

<h1>Step 2: Visual Studio Code</h1>
1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE.

2. Navigate to the "DataVisualizationProject" folder using the File menu or the integrated terminal in VS Code.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named "TwoDataVisualizarionInteraction.ipynb" from the folder.

4. Inside the notebook, modify the base_folderPath variable by providing the correct path to the "DataVisualizationProject" folder on your system. For example, if you placed the "DataVisualizationProject" folder in "D:/MyPythonProjects," update the base_folderPath to "D:/MyPythonProjects/DataVisualizationProject."


<h1>Step 3: Virtual Environment Setup</h1>
1. Create a virtual environment named "VisualizationEnv" in your project folder by running the following command in the terminal:
python -m venv VisualizationEnv

2. Activate your newly created virtual environment using the following command:
VisualizationEnv\Scripts\activate

3. Install all the required libraries for your project using the command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

<h1>Step 4: Running the Project</h1>

1. With the virtual environment activated, you can now run your Python project by executing the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Enjoy exploring the data visualization functionalities of your project!


Note:
Make sure to keep your virtual environment activated whenever you work on the project to ensure that you are using the correct Python interpreter and library versions specified in the requirements.txt file.
